Hi, just a new coder here haha. I literally don't know nothing about some languages, but anymays, I'm only 16.

I want to learn as much as I can because I feel so satysfyed by doing some projects for FiveM and it's a little bit annoying cause I am not sucha a good coder, but I wish to!
So that's why I'm here, to learn and to teach, but principally to understand.

Feel free to talk to me.

PD: I'm Spanish and I know English and French, but not that much xD. See u :)
